# Hand Sign Detection

Hand Sign Detection is a real-time application that identifies and classifies hand signs using a webcam. This project leverages Python 3.9, OpenCV, and machine learning to detect specific hand gestures and predict their meanings.

## Features

- **Real-time Hand Detection**: Detects a single hand in a webcam feed.
- **Hand Gesture Classification**: Classifies hand signs into predefined categories such as "Hello," "I Love You," "Okay," and "Thank You."
- **Dynamic Bounding Boxes**: Displays bounding boxes and predictions in the webcam feed.
- **Scalable**: Easily extendable to include more gestures by retraining the model.

## Installation and Setup

### Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.9 or higher is installed, then run:
```bash
pip install opencv-python cvzone numpy
```

### Download the Model Files
Place the pre-trained model (`keras_model.h5`) and the label file (`labels.txt`) in a directory of your choice. Update their paths in the script accordingly.

### Run the Application
Execute the following command:
```bash
python hand_sign_detection.py
```

## How It Works

### Hand Detection
- The script uses `cvzone.HandTrackingModule` to detect a single hand in the webcam feed.
- Bounding boxes are drawn around detected hands.

### Image Preprocessing
- The cropped image of the hand is resized and centered on a white background for consistent input to the classifier.

### Classification
- A pre-trained model (`keras_model.h5`) is used to classify hand gestures.
- The result is displayed on the screen as text.

## Example Gestures

The following gestures are supported in this implementation:

1. **Hello**
2. **I Love You**
3. **Okay**
4. **Thank You**

You can extend this by retraining the model with additional gestures.



## Project Structure

```
hand-sign-detection/
├── hand_sign_detection.py  # Main script
├── keras_model.h5          # Pre-trained model
├── labels.txt              # Labels for the gestures
├── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Customizing the Model

1. Collect a dataset of hand gestures with images labeled accordingly.
2. Train a new model using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. Replace the existing `keras_model.h5` and `labels.txt` files with your updated versions.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for multi-hand detection.
- Expand the gesture dataset for more categories.
- Enhance the UI for better user interaction.
